Then edit the default configuration file:vi ./config.py\n\nFor now let's use the default settings. Type this command in your terminal:python ./build.py\n\n...and a sample static site is generated in test_dist folder! You can then upload them to GitHub Pages or any other server.Generate your own site\nBy default, Maverick searches all .md files recursively under test_src folder, so put your Markdown files in it and run python ./build.py then everything you need will be in test_dist folder.
