Before that, let's finish this document.\nUsage\nMaverick is build with modern Python, currently at least Python 3.5 is required, make sure you have it installed on your machine.\nInstall\nClone this repository:\ngit clone https://github.com/AlanDecode/Maverick.git ./Maveric &amp;&amp; cd ./Maveric\n\nInstall all dependencies:\npip install -r prod_req.txt\n\nIf error occurs, please verify your Python and pip version. Then edit the default configuration file:\nvi ./config.py\n\nFor now let's use the default settings. Type this command in your terminal:\npython ./build.py\n\n...and a sample static site is generated in test_dist folder! You can then upload them to GitHub Pages or any other server.\nGenerate your own site\nBy default, Maverick searches all .md files recursively under test_src folder, so put your Markdown files in it and run python ./build.py then everything you need will be in test_dist folder. Maverick uses so-called YAML frontmatter to get meta data of your articles, if you have tried Hexo or Jekyll, you should be familiar with it; if you don't, let's look into it now.\n......\nRead the full documentation here.\nLicense\nMIT \u00a9 AlanDecode.\n", "categories": [{"slug": "Maverick", "permalink": "/Maverick/category/Maverick/", "name": "Maverick"}], "title": "Overview of Maverick"}, {"date": "2018-11-09T23:41:00-00.00", "tags": [{"slug": "Design", "permalink": "/Maverick/tag/Design/", "name": "Design"}, {"slug": "Typography", "permalink": "/Maverick/tag/Typography/", "name": "Typography"}], "path": "/Maverick/archives/typography/", "text": "This is an sample article.
